:::warning TO BE DONE
Content in this section is under development.

This section will cover computing the next state of individual cells and the group as a whole based on the current state.
:::

```javascript
/**
 * Grow (or shrink) the given cell based on its growth rate.
 *
 * @param {object} currentCell the cell to grow or shrink
 * @returns {object} a new cell object that has grown (or shrank)
 */
function nextCellBehavior(currentCell) {
  let { size, growth, maxSize, minSize } = currentCell;
  size = size + growth;

  // Make sure the new size fits within the cell's maximum and minimum
  if (growth > 0) {
    size = Math.min(size, maxSize);
  } else {
    size = Math.max(size, minSize);
  }

  // If the new size is at the cell's maximum or minimum size, reverse the
  // direction of growth.
  if (size === minSize || size === maxSize) {
    growth = growth * -1;
  }

  return {
    size,
    growth,
    maxSize,
    minSize,
  };
}
```

```javascript
/**
 * Create a new behavior grid where each cell in the given grid has been
 * resized according to its current growth rate.
 *
 * @param {Array<Array<object>>} currentState
 * @returns {Array<Array<object>>} a two dimensional array of the cells
 */
function nextBehaviorGrid(currentState) {
  const width = currentState.length;
  let cells = [];

  for (let x = 0; x < width; x++) {
    const height = currentState[x].length;
    cells[x] = [];

    for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) {
      cells[x][y] = nextCellBehavior(currentState[x][y]);
    }
  }

  return cells;
}
```
