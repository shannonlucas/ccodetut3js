scene. In this module, you will add objects to your 3D scene, group them together, and then rotate the group as a whole. At the end of this module, you will have created the 3D scene shown below.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"adding-objects/checkpoint":{"id":"adding-objects/checkpoint","title":"Checkpoint","description":"Below you will find all the code you\'ve assembled up to this point in the tutorial.

Recall that the desired result is to have those cells tilted on a corner and, eventually, to have them rotate as a group around a central axis.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"adding-objects/spinning-grid":{"id":"adding-objects/spinning-grid","title":"Spinning the grid","description":"You\'ll finish this module by making the grid you\'ve created rotate as a whole around the vertical axis of your screen.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"introduction":{"id":"introduction","title":"Creative coding with three.js","description":"The idea of using programming as a creative medium isn\'t new. In fact, people began using computers as a creative outlet almost as soon as computers became widely available.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"scene-setup/adding-camera":{"id":"scene-setup/adding-camera","title":"Adding the camera","description":"The camera is what \\"sees\\" your scene. What it sees is what gets rendered on your display. There are many types of cameras in three.js, and you can even have more than one in a scene and switch between them. For this tutorial, we will use a single PerspectiveCamera. This type of camera will cause objects to be rendered like they would appear in the real world: objects in the distance will appear smaller than objects that are closer.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"scene-setup/adding-lights":{"id":"scene-setup/adding-lights","title":"Adding lights","description":"Your scene needs one or more light sources so the objects in the scene will be visible. Lights can have colors and types (e.g., point lights and spotlights).","sidebar":"sidebar"},"scene-setup/adding-renderer":{"id":"scene-setup/adding-renderer","title":"Adding the renderer","description":"The renderer is what translates your 3D scene into pixels on your display. It is the bridge between the mathematical models of the objects in your scene and the hardware that generates images on your display.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"scene-setup/animation-loop":{"id":"scene-setup/animation-loop","title":"The animation loop","description":"So far, you\'ve focused only on the mechanics of how a scene gets rendered. You\'ll now move on to when a scene gets rendered and updated.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"scene-setup/checkpoint":{"id":"scene-setup/checkpoint","title":"Checkpoint","description":"You\'ll find all the code you\'ve assembled up to this point in the tutorial below.

The amount of code you\'ve produced may seem small, but you\'ve learned some core concepts of 3D scenes and animation and then put those concepts to use with three.js.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"scene-setup/put-it-together":{"id":"scene-setup/put-it-together","title":"Putting it together","description":"Now that you\'ve assembled the lights, camera, and renderer, it\'s time to put those pieces together and actually create a scene. In a 3D scene, there\'s an invisible container that holds everything to be rendered and everything that affects the rendering (such as your lights and camera). This container is usually just called a \\"scene,\\" and it\'s how your computer makes sense of the objects you want to display.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"scene-setup/quick-demo":{"id":"scene-setup/quick-demo","title":"A quick demo","description":"So far, you\'ve done a lot of work, but you haven\'t been able to see any outcome of that work. The overall goal of this module has been to guide you through building a foundation that can be used both for this tutorial and your future projects.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"scene-setup/scene-setup":{"id":"scene-setup/scene-setup","title":"Setting up a scene","description":"In this module, you\'ll build the foundation for the rest of the tutorial. This part isn\'t exciting, but it\'s necessary. What you build in this module will be useful when you begin experimenting on your own.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"wrapping-up":{"id":"wrapping-up","title":"Wrapping Up","description":"Content in this section is under development.","sidebar":"sidebar"}}}')}}]);
