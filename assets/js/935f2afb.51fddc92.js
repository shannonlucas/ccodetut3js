However, they don\'t have to be cubes, and when a generic term is more appropriate, the term \\"cell\\" will be used. Using this term will also reduce confusion about the many meanings of the term \\"object\\" in the context of graphics programming.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"adding-objects/postscript":{"id":"adding-objects/postscript","title":"Postscript","description":"In this module, you added objects to your scene and then animated them together as a group.
