So far, you've done a _lot_ of work, but you haven't been able to see any
outcomes of that work. The overall goal of this module has been to guide you
through building a foundation that can be used both for this tutorial and your
future projects.

Now you will create a quick demo to verify that the code you've assembled so is
working as intended.

Remove your empty `update` function and replace it with the code below. There
are a few things in the code below that you haven't seen yet. You will learn
about these in the next module.

```javascript
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Demonstration code
// TODO: Remove before proceeding to the next module
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: "#aaa" });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

mesh.position.set(0, 0, -4);

scene.add(mesh);

function update() {
  mesh.rotation.y += 0.0075;
  mesh.rotation.x += 0.0075;
}
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

After you copy and paste this code into your code playground, run the code. If
you have assembled everything correctly, you will see a rotating cube like
the one in the figure below.

![Animation of a rotating cube produced by the demo at the end of this module](./assets/scene-setup-demo.gif "This module's demo")

If you don't see a rotating cube, review your code to make sure you didn't miss
anything during assembly. You can also compare your code with the code listed in
this module's [checkpoint](./checkpoint.mdx).

When you are done with the demo and, replace it with the empty `update` function
from the previous section.

```javascript
function update() {
  // Your project's animation code will go here.
}
```

## Optional exercises

If you would like to experiment with the demo before moving on to the next
module, here are some ideas to try.

* Pick one of the lights and try changing some of its properties. For example,
  change its color or position. Experiment with one light at a time so that you
  can see how changing one affects the scene.
* In the demo's `update` function, change the rotation speeds to be different
  values. Observe how this affects the cube's behavior.
* Change the value of `MILLISECONDS_PER_FRAME` to a different value such as
  `1000 / 30` or `1000 / 120`. What changes do you notice?
* In the demo code, replace `THREE.BoxGeometry()` with
  `THREE.DodecahedronGeometry()`. What differences, if any, do you notice in
  how the light and shadows interact with this shape?

## Moving forward

If you have done any experimenting with the exercises, be sure to restore your
code to its previous state before moving on to the next module. If you are
unsure what you have changed, you can get your code back to the tutorial state
by copying it from this module's [checkpoint](./checkpoint.mdx).
