If you would like to experiment with the demo before moving on to the next module, here are some ideas to try.

* Pick one of the lights and try changing some of its properties. For example, change its color or position. Experiment with one light at a time so that you can see how changing one affects the scene.
* In the demo's `update` function, change the rotation speeds to be different values. Observe how this affects the cube's behavior.
* Change the value of `MILLISECONDS_PER_FRAME` to a different value such as `1000 / 30` or `1000 / 120`. What changes do you notice?
* In the demo code, replace `THREE.BoxGeometry()` with `THREE.DodecahedronGeometry()`. What differences, if any, do you notice in how the light and shadows interact with this shape?

## Moving forward

If you have done any experimenting with the exercises, be sure to restore your code to its previous state before moving on to the next module. If you are unsure what you have changed, you can get your code back to the tutorial state by copying it from this module's [checkpoint](./checkpoint.mdx).
