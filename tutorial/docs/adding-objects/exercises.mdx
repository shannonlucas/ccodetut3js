If you would like to experiment with the project before moving on to the next
module, here are some ideas to try.

* Modify the `buildCellVisual` function so that it creates a shape other than
  a cube.
* Modify the `buildCellVisual` function so that it creates a random shape each
  time it is called. Limit the possible random shapes to `THREE.BoxGeometry`,
  `THREE.ConeGeometry` and `THREE.SphereGeometry`.
* Consider the logic that determines where to place the camera:
  
  ```javascript
  camera.position.set(0, 0, GRID_SIZE * (MAX_CELL_SIZE + CELL_SPACING));
  ```

  How you might modify the `setUpLights` function so that the position of the
  lights is determined by the size of your rotating grid? _**Note**: this is an
  advanced exercise_.

## Moving forward

If you have done any experimenting with the exercises, be sure to restore your
code to its previous state before moving on to the next module. If you are
unsure what you have changed, you can get your code back to the tutorial state
by copying it from this module's [checkpoint](./checkpoint.mdx).
