## Positioning the camera

```javascript
// Move the camera far enough from our cells that we can see all of them.
camera.position.set(0, 0, GRID_SIZE * (MAX_CELL_SIZE + CELL_SPACING));
```

## Spinning the grid

```javascript
// The number of radians the grid rotates each frame
const ROTATION_SPEED = 0.0075;

function update() {
  cellGroup.rotation.y += ROTATION_SPEED;
}
```
