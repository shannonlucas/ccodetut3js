You'll finish this module by making the grid you've created rotate as a whole around the vertical axis of your screen.

Begin by creating a constant to store the rotation speed. This will be how many radians the group should rotate each frame. When you created your animation loop in the [previous module](./../scene-setup/animation-loop.mdx), it was set
to render 60 frames each second. So your rotation speed is going to be a small number.

```javascript
const ROTATION_SPEED = 0.0075;
```

All that remains is to modify the `update` function to increment the grid's y-axis rotation property.

```javascript
function update() {
  cellGroup.rotation.y += ROTATION_SPEED;
}
```

Run your code now, and you will see the animation below.
