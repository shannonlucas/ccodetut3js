## Optional exercises

If you would like to experiment with the demo before moving on to the next module, here are some things to try. Once you're done experimenting, be sure to restore your code to its previous state before moving on to the next module. If you are unsure what you have changed, you can get your code back to the tutorial state by copying it from this module's [checkpoint](./checkpoint.mdx).

* When you build the behavior grid, try passing a value for `maxSize` that is slightly larger than `MAX_CELL_SIZE`. What effect did this have on the scene?
