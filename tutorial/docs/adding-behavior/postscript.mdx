:::warning TO BE DONE

In this module, you added behavior to the objects in your scene and learned about managing state separately from its visual representation. State and behavior are difficult topics, so don't feel bad if you don't feel like you have a good grip on it right now. As you experiment further with creative coding, you will gain a more intuitive feel for these concepts.

## Optional exercises

If you would like to experiment with the demo before moving on to the next module, here are some things to try. If you feel that you've broken something and want to get back to where you started, you can copy and paste the code from this
module's [checkpoint][CHECKPOINT] which will have all the code you assembled in this module.

* When you build the behavior grid, try passing a value for `maxSize` that is slightly larger than `MAX_CELL_SIZE`. What effect did this have on the scene?

## Additional resources

[CHECKPOINT]: ./checkpoint.mdx
