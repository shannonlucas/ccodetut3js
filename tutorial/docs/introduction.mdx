title: Creative coding with three.js
---

The idea of using programming as a creative medium isn't new. In fact, people began using computers as a creative outlet almost as soon as computers became widely available.

Creative coding differs from traditional programming in that the intent is expression rather than function. This intention separates it from traditional software development, and even from game development. Though in the case of the latter, the line between expression and function is often blurry.

Tinkering and experimentation are embraced by creative coding. And there are many "happy accidents," in the words of painter Bob Ross, that lead to interesting and engaging works.

## What will you learn?

This tutorial will guide you through assembling a set of building blocks that you can use to experiment with 3D graphics in your web browser. You will then assemble a complete project using these building blocks. The animation below is what you will be building.

You will be using JavaScript and [three.js](https://threejs.org/) for this project. Three.js is a general purpose 3D graphics library that works in modern web browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari. Because the goal of this tutorial is to leave you with tools you can reuse, you will find that it is longer than most introductory three.js tutorials.

## Who is this tutorial for?

This tutorial is for anyone who wants to use programming as a way to create visual expressions and who has some experience with JavaScript. This tutorial will not teach you how to program, and if you are completely new to programming, you should complete an introductory tutorial first. You will find links to introductory JavaScript tutorials in the ["Additional resources"](./wrapping-up/additional-resources.mdx) section.

If you are unsure, you should be familiar with these JavaScript concepts: variables, types, arrays, objects, loops, `if` statements, and functions.

If 

## What this tutorial is not

* this should not be your first programming project
* the goal is not to teach you javascript
* will not teach HTML or CSS
* not a goal to make a game
* not a goal to find you a programming job
* following three.js code conventions with SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

## How this tutorial is structured

* modules
* checkpoints

As you progress through this section, copy and paste each block of JavaScript code at the end of the JavaScript panel of your code playground.

## Purpose

## End Goal

## Background

## Prerequisites

* Many great ideas come form experimentation and tinkering
* Mostly skipping performance optimization in preference to clarity
* Deliberately left room for improvement

* Reasons for choosing three.js vs others
* [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net)
* [JSFiddle Docs](https://docs.jsfiddle.net)

## How to enter the code

## SI Units

* distances are in meters (m)
* rotation angles in radians (rad)
* lights intensity in candela (cd)
* degrees used in some places (&deg;)
